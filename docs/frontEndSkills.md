## Front-end Developer Skills

### Write semantic
  - Writing semantic markup means understanding the hierarchy of your content and how both users and machines will ready it.
  - Accessibility cannot be achieved without quality and semantically valid HTML.
  - Example: H1 for titles

### Write standards-compliant code
  - Standards-compliance is the compliance of a website or web browser with the web standards of the W3C. To ensure interoperability a standards-compliant web site does not use proprietary software methods or features of a browser. 
  - DOCTYPE: explains the document type being rendered.
  - <html lang="end">: Internationalization
  - <meta charset="utf-8">: encoding to use when rendering the content of a site.
  - Entity reference: should be used for characters with special meaning in HTML.
  - <title>: provide a title
  - indentation: properly indented shows hierarchy. 2 spaces.
  - Separation of concerns: import JS and CSS.
  - Proper use of HTML elements: do not use an <a> element where a <button> should be used. Avoid divits (the act of writing many div elements in place of meaningful semantic HTML elements)
  - Understand the meaning difference between <i> and <em>, <bold> and <strong>. Semantic elements - main, nav, section, article, aside, footer should always be used to describe contents of a website instead of using a div.
  - Use <time>
  - In HTML, use double quotation marks for attribute values.
  - Use alternate text for images.
  - Form labeling should be associated with labels either implicitly or explicitly:
    - Implicit: <label><input /></label> or Explicit: <label></label><input />
  - Avoid Shouting: no capital letters. If you need to capitalize anything, use CSS text-transform: uppercase;
  - Naming Convention: id and classes should be descriptive: It needs to relate to the content, not the presentation. 
  - Link to external documents: The rel attribute with value of noopener noreferrer should always be added to <a> elements when linking to external documentals.
  - Code Validation: W3C validator
